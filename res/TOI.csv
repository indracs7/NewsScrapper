Some senior members of the club had come to his rescue and allowed him to go, but he was allegedly chased by the same group again, who then allegedly drove out his passengers, got inside the car, assaulted him and snatched Rs 12,000 from him.The incident happened at Naktala crossing on NSC Bose Road around 9pm when the organisers of Naktala Sarbojonin Durga Puja Committee, popularly known as Dalgis Club Puja, had taken out the immersion procession. The club organisers, however, rubbished the claims and said they had only chased the car as it had hit one of the club members, who suffered a head injury. They refused to have snatched anything from the driver.Haldar from Sonarpur was driving a sedan with three passengers. He had gone back home after the assault and lodged a complaint with Netaji Nagar police the next morning. Cops have started a probe, got hold of the CCTV grabs of the area and even questioned some of the club members. But none have been arrested till late on Sunday.Haldar had been driving down NSC Bose Road with three men, who had hired his car to visit the Kalighat temple. On their way back, they got caught in the immersion procession of Naktala Sarbojanin Durgotsab Committee around 9pm. “Most of them seemed drunk and kept dancing on the road, halting traffic. We moved slowly behind the procession looking for a way to get past them. Suddenly, some of them started banging the car bonnet and when I protested, an argument broke out and some of them slapped me. Soon, others came and took them away. They cleared a part of the road and let my car move ahead,” said Haldar.Even as he drove ahead and reached Lakshminarayan bridge, almost a kilometre away, Haldar noticed that a few bikes from the precession were following his car. Soon, they blocked the road and forced him to stop the car. “They charged me of knocking down a youth while I was driving through the procession. I was held by the collar and my car keys were snatched. I was taken out and assaulted. When the passengers protested, they were pushed and abused,” Haldar told TOI.The passengers were allegedly forced to get out of the car while some of the accused asked Haldar to drive the car. “I was taken to a deserted lane and asked to get down. They snatched my purse and forced me to hand over a bag in which I was carrying money for my father’s treatment. He is a cancer patient and I had borrowed the money,” said Haldar.One of the passengers, Argya Dasgupta, said the men demanded compensation for knocking down a club member.Dasgupta had managed to take a photograph of one of the bikes and cops tracked down its owner from the registration number and called him to the police station. Madhusudan Poddar, the bike owner, claimed himself to be an electrician hired by the club. He told TOI that he had not seen anyone getting hit by a car. He added that some club members had sat pillion on his bike and asked him to chase the car.Sourav Das, a member of the Dalgis club, alleged Haldar was cooking up a story and said that he was the one who had hit one of their club members. “The driver was speeding along the road and knocked down one of our club members. So we followed him. But none of our members robbed him,” he said."
1,2019-09-19T12:35:40+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: At least two persons were killed and six seriously injured in four different accidents across the city. In the first accident, four persons were injured around 4.30am on Wednesday when a truck collided with a private car at Diamond Park close to Thakurpukur. Subhajit Das (39), his wife, Barnali Das (33), Abhijit Manna (38) and Bula Das (35) who were travelling in the private car were coming to the city from Bishnupur. All the victims were rushed to the Bangur Medical Research institute. Manna was later shifted to ESI Hospital, Joka after his condition worsened. Cops who started an investigation into the accident blamed the truck driver for reckless driving. However, locals said the miserable condition of the road was also responsible for the accident. In the second accident, an unidentified man, aged around 50 years, was found dead beside a rickshaw on the DH Road on Wednesday afternoon. Though locals found the man’s death mysterious, cops did not rule out the chance that he had met with a fatal accident. In another accident, a biker lost his life and the pillion rider was seriously injured after the two-wheeler hit a median divider near 6 No. bus stand on NSC Bose Road around 3am. The deceased, Indranil Das (24), was a resident of Bijoygarh. The condition of the pillion rider, Alok Das (23), a resident of Azadgarh, was stated to be critical. Another rider was injured when his two-wheeler skidded on the Dhakuria flyover in midnight on Monday. The victim, Ankit Shaw (29), received head injuries and is undergoing treatment at AMRI Hospital."

The accident took place at around 2.20 pm at the crossing of Red Road and Mayo road near police memorial when the driver of a private bus suddenly applied the brake and two other buses from behind rammed into it, a senior officer of Kolkata police said. As a result, eight passengers received minor injuries and were rushed to SSKM hospital, he said. The driver of the offending private bus managed to flee but the drivers of the two other buses have been taken to the Maidan police station, the officer added."
3,2019-09-17T13:34:02+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: Almost nine months after the Kolkata traffic police claimed to have proposed the installation of nets, view cutters or even the advanced crash barriers up to four feet — on the southern flank of the Maa flyover in order to reduce chances of alloy-coated kite strings causing accidents and injuries to bikers — the traffic police now plans to make arrangements for nets to try and stop the area from becoming a suicide point.“It is third time now that someone has climbed on to the Maa flyover from the Park Circus side or the Pragati Maidan side and tried to commit suicide. The stretch between the 7-point crossing and the No. 4 bridge has also seen bikers tumbling over. It is important we try and convince the civic agencies — in this case the KMDA — on the utility of these barriers,” said a top IPS officer. Cops have also proposed to increase patrol on the flyover from both ends to stop a repeat of the incident where Sajad Murmu of South Dinajpur allegedly ended his life. The proposal for nets was forwarded to the KMDA through Lalbazar by the various traffic guards after studying the past accidents and suicides and looking for practical solutions. “While the local police stations might be struggling with the regular patrol, it is difficult to predict when a thread can cause an accident. We cannot predict the loss of lives due to accidents or when someone might become suicidal. But the nets can at least act as a deterrent,” said an officer.“More than one suicide at a particular site should always give cause for concern,” said a psychiatrist working with Kolkata police."
4,2019-10-13T06:00:23+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: Two buses competing with each other resulted in yet another serious accident close to Science City where a biker received serious injuries on his leg. The incident took place on Saturday evening when the biker was illegally overtaking one of the buses. The impact was such that the bike got dragged and sparks started emitting from its body. The buses and two wheelers remain two major concerns for traffic cops as both contribute to maximum number of accidents in the city. Fortunately, the biker managed to escape with injuries to his leg. The incident took place on close to Science City on EM Bypass. According to Pragati Maidan police, the biker in his early 30s was trying to overtake a bus after crossing the Parama Island. While trying to do so, he moved to the extreme left lane and accelerated. “At that time, the bus plying on the Taratala-Airport route was trying to block the path of another bus after picking up passengers. When the second bus zipped to its left trying to block the path of the Taratala bus, the Taratala bound bus moved further left.The biker came on its rear path and got hit by the bus. He tumbled and fell on the road. With the incident taking place right next to the police station and a traffic guard, the cops took the victim to the hospital. Till evening, the cops were still at the hospital noting down his statement. Police chased the bus on to the Ambedkar flyover and detained the driver. The bus, too, was seized. The other bus, however, managed to escape.Saturday’s accident took place in the zones that are marked as black spots on the EM Bypass. EM Bypass had three blackspots — Metropolitan City-Dhapa stretch, the Panchannagram stretch and the Parama Island in 2018. “This was a classic case of both the biker and the bus drivers not obeying rules and cutting lanes. We have time and again held workshops for bus drivers and bikers and issued them challans. As for buses, we feel the commission system contributes to bus competing with one another and leading to accidents,” explained an officer from the Tiljala traffic guard.Tapan Banerjee of Joint Council of Bus Syndicate said blaming the commissioning system will not address the issue of gross traffic rule violations."
5,2019-08-12T05:32:22+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: A 21-year-old helmetless biker, Abhishek Roy, was killed and his friend Manisha Roy (18) critically injured early on Sunday after Abhishek’s unregistered motorcycle crashed into a median divider on EM Bypass near Mani Square. None of them was wearing a helmet when the accident took place, said police.Soon after the cops took them to a private hospital off Bypass, Abhishek died of his injuries. Manisha is still admitted there in a very critical condition.TimesViewMultiple studies tell us that tragedies like this can be avoided if only riders wear helmets. Yet, there is a curious reluctance to wear this basic necessity. Cops have conducted several sensitisation programmes and campaigns. Perhaps, it is time to repeat that.Family sources said it was Manisha’s birthday last night. Abhishek — the only son of Basanta Cabin owner Amarnath Roy — picked her up from her Muraripukur home around 10.30pm. “Manisha told us that she was going for dinner with Abhishek and would be back before midnight. When it was too late, we got worried and tried to contact her, but there was no response. Finally, around 2.30am, a male voice from the other end told us that he was a policeman and requested us to rush to the hospital, since her condition was very serious,” said Mrittika Roy, Manisha’s sister-in-law.At Roy’s home in 288A APC Road, Abhishek’s septuagenarian grandmother Jamuna Roy said: “He had told us that he was going for a friend’s birthday party. A little after 10.30pm, he called up his mother to say that he would be late. That was the last time we heard from him.” His father could not be reached for comments.Police said the kind of damage the vehicle suffered indicated that it was on a high speed. The road, too, was slippery because of sporadic rain and that might have caused the accident. According to police sources, both victims were on the road — severely bleeding — when the cops reached the spot. “They had suffered multiple bleeding injuries, including severe head injuries,” said a police source.The Fatal Squad Traffic Police (FSTP) is handling the investigation. The damaged vehicle will undergo a forensic test. Police are also trying to find out whether the helmetless duo was intercepted by any naka check."
6,2019-08-10T05:48:46+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: A 65-year-old tailor from Dhakuria — who also trades in clothing material — almost had his ears torn off when he was thrown off the bus he had just boarded near Gariahat crossing on Friday. His finger were crushed and an elbow was also fractured in the accident that was reported around 9.40am. Samir Pal came under the wheels of a second bus which was competing with the one he was on and tried to overtake it from the left. The victim was taken to a private hospital in Dhakuria before being shifted to another hospital off EM Bypass by his family. Pal will have to undergo corrective surgeries for his injuries. However, doctors said he was stable. The locals claimed the accident took place as the second bus — plying on Route 3C/2 — was trying to overtake the Route 212 bus from the left. The two vehicles, which share a common route for a considerable stretch, had been racing with each other since Bijon Setu. Traffic cops, though, said CCTV footage suggest the victim was also negligent. “Pal had tried to spit out gutka while standing on the footboard. The Route 212 bus was standing at a signal near Citimart, about 30m from Gariahat crossing, and the signal had just turned green. The bus started with a jerk and Pal lost his balance and fell off. The 3C/2 driver would have run him over but braked at the last moment,” said an officer.The local police, however, said they have not found any evidence that Pal had been chewing gutka. He had boarded the bus from Haltu and was headed to Bhowanipore College with his son who had his Part II exams on Friday. The victim told Gariahat police that he was standing behind the conductor, and not on the footboard, when the jerk threw him off. Doctors at Peerless Hospital, where he is admitted, said Pal’s condition was stable. “There is no immediate danger to his life. He needs a complete reconstruction of his ears and we have to carry out several surgeries. He has to be under prolonged treatment,” said one of the senior doctors.“The injuries to the ears are only external. No internal injury has been found. We are planning plastic surgery to repair them. Currently, he is being treated in our emergency unit and we will shift him to the ward soon,” said Peerless CEO Dr Sudipto Mitra. “The accident happened because the second bus was trying to overtake the first one, which was standing in the middle of the road. The victim was bleeding profusely, with one of his ears hanging. The other ear seemed crushed,” said Jaydeep Ray, a shop employee who saw the accident.Cops on Friday launched a drive where passengers on government buses were asked to get off if they were found crowding near the gates. “This is a question of life and death and passengers must realize that footboards are not meant for travelling,” said an officer..(With inputs from Ayush Roy)"

But he continued to use his scooter to reach office as he was yet to get a four-wheeler driving licence. On Monday, he was thrown off the scooter while negotiating a treacherous stretch on E M Bypass and came under a bus.“Since their daughter was born, his wife used to tell him to get rid of his scooter. Prodded by her constant nudge and the deplorable condition of roads, he bought a second-hand car. He had also started to learn driving but was yet to get his hands set on the wheels and get a driving licence,” said Nasimul Islam, Samim’s brother-in-law.Just a few days before the accident, even Samim had told him that he was planning to let go of the scooter because of the poor condition of the stretch — GT Road, Belghoria Expressway, VIP Road and EM Bypass – he regularly rode to reach his office at Kasba Industrial Estate. “He had plans to give up the scooter and drive to office from his home in his car. But he died even before he could shift to the four-wheel drive,” said Islam.Samim was even looking for a flat in south Kolkata and was trying to shift to the city to cut down on his travel time.

The colleagues even rushed to the hospital and had made the hospital authorities aware of the accident and that they were bringing in a critical patient, but he never arrived.“I kept on calling Samim’s number but none responded. I then went up to the traffic guard at Ruby crossing and sought help from an officer about the whereabouts of Samim.

15,2019-08-27T06:30:13+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: Come what may, you will never find a Kavi Subhas-bound rake leaving the Dum Dum station from the Up platform. This is a procedure that Metro Railway sometimes follows at other stations when tracks are blocked due to a technical snag. Trains arriving at a platform depart from there and then change over to the proper line midway. Similarly, clear instructions have been given to operating staff to not evacuate Down rakes during peak hours at Dum Dum if there is any possibility of running them. Any attempt to evacuate a rake could result in a stampede-like situation.“When a Down train enters the platform during the morning peak hours, there are over a thousand people waiting. Passengers keep pouring in. Unless we have trains to get them out, there would be total chaos. That is what happened on Wednesday morning. We checked the CCTV footage later and realised that there were nearly 4,000 passengers on the train and platform while efforts were being made to shut one of the doors. It was a good decision to start the train with due protection,” Metro Railway principal chief operations manager Satyaki Nath said.No other station comes even close to Dum Dum’s passenger count. The next in line are the Esplanade and Rabindra Sadan stations. These stations handle about 50,000 passengers every day. Metro expects a huge rush of Puja shoppers at Esplanade from September 16 and has started taking precaution. However, all efforts will be made to clear the rush at Dum Dum, even if it means running a train with a door open, as it happened on Wednesday.“We have some space at Esplanade station and the crowd of shoppers move from both directions. Its different at Dum Dum. During the morning peak hours, all passengers are south-bound and on the Down platform. On Wednesday, there was no way we could have reversed the affected rake. Had we decided to reverse a rake towards the Down direction from the Up platform, there would have been a stampede on the stairs. Some people might have tried to cross the tracks (and electrified third rails) to reach the Up platform. Hence, we have instructed Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel at Dum Dum to maintain a strict watch so that nobody gets down on the tracks,” Nath added.On Wednesday, more people might have reached the platform at Dum Dum had the booking counters not been shut down. Senior officers urged passengers to behave rationally and not try to get into a train when there is no space."

Police said the woman, a resident of Barisha in Thakurpukur, met with the accident around 4.25pm on Tuesday.The victim, Riti Ambuli, was unmarried and earned a living by offering tuitions.Cops believe the woman was probably on her way back home when the incident took place. Cops at the Rabindra Sarobar police station have registered a case of death due to rash and negligent driving and are investigating the case. The driver of the government bus, which plies between Behala 14 number and New Town, has been arrested.In another incident, a WBTC bus seriously injured a pedestrian around 9pm on Monday. The pedestrian, Usha Rani Saha (70), was trying to cross the road at the Behala Tram Depot when the bus plying between Esplanade and Boral hit the woman. Her condition is critical, said cops quoting doctors.A recent analysis has found that 19 accidents taking place in the past two months are either due to passengers getting off moving buses, coming in front buses and slipping off the footboard. The most recent one saw a 46-yearold tailor standing on the footboard of a government bus negotiating a narrow and congested road in Haridevpur. The passenger lost his left arm after it was ripped off when the elbow got caught in the wedge of a building’s corner.“We will begin a special drive in this regard soon. The aim is to inculcate the best practices,” said DC (traffic) Santosh Pandey. The cops said they will be speaking to transport experts and even bus manufacturers in this regard. “The AC buses are the best option. But it is the private sector, whom we want to regulate,” said an officer."

19,2019-09-19T10:51:32+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: Exactly four weeks after 25-year-old Raghib Parwez was arrested for allegedly being in the driver’s seat of the Jaguar that collided with a Mercedes-Benz, leading to the death of two Bangladeshi executives on the Shakespeare Sarani-Loudon Street crossing, the detective department has filed the charge sheet in the case. Besides Raghib, the primary accused, his younger brother Arsalan, 22, has also been named in the charge sheet along with their maternal uncle Md Hamza.Raghib has been charged under IPC sections 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs 50) and 279 (rash driving). “He has also been slapped with Section 3 of The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 (mischief causing damage to public property) and 119/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act (disobeying of traffic signal),” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.Raghib is in judicial custody while his brother and uncle are out on bail. Though Lalbazar officers hinted they were mulling asking for a custody trial, the defence lawyers said that now that the charge sheet has been submitted, they are talking to legal experts on approaching the courts for Raghib’s bail.Arsalan has been charged with IPC section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender). Arsalan was initially produced before police by the family as the one behind the wheels. Another 48 hours later, during sustained questioning, cops came to know that he was lying. Hamza has been charged under IPC sections 201 and 212 (harbours or conceals a person). It was Hamza who was the first family member to meet Raghib after the accident and was instrumental in sending the elder Parwez brother and his mother to Dubai the next evening. The cops said the charge sheet runs over 400 pages and officers have cited as many as 63 witnesses. Two of them hold the key to the case — Raghib’s friend who was travelling with him in the car on August 16 and fled the scene after the accident, and the Bangladeshi survivor who saw his friends die. Cops have relied hugely on technical evidence — CCTV footage and mobile locations, along with data supplied about the crash by Jaguar Land Rover. Sources said the probe has revealed that after leaving his Syed Amir Ali Avenue residence, Raghib had crossed Park Circus seven-point crossing and headed towards Mullickbazar. He attended a party at a friend’s place and then then drove towards Elliot Road and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road with another friend. He finally headed towards JL Nehru Road and took Shakespeare Sarani Road before meeting with the accident at 1.50am."
