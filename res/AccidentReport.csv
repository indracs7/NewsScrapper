1,2019-10-14T10:16:38+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: A 29-year-old youth driving a car was allegedly assaulted by a group of men taking part in an immersion procession by a local club as he tried to drive past the revellers on a narrow NSC Bose Road near Naktala on Friday night.The victim, Ujjal Haldar, alleged that the men first assaulted him for daring to drive past the procession and thumped against the car. Some senior members of the club had come to his rescue and allowed him to go, but he was allegedly chased by the same group again, who then allegedly drove out his passengers, got inside the car, assaulted him and snatched Rs 12,000 from him.The incident happened at Naktala crossing on NSC Bose Road around 9pm when the organisers of Naktala Sarbojonin Durga Puja Committee, popularly known as Dalgis Club Puja, had taken out the immersion procession. The club organisers, however, rubbished the claims and said they had only chased the car as it had hit one of the club members, who suffered a head injury. They refused to have snatched anything from the driver.Haldar from Sonarpur was driving a sedan with three passengers. He had gone back home after the assault and lodged a complaint with Netaji Nagar police the next morning. Cops have started a probe, got hold of the CCTV grabs of the area and even questioned some of the club members. But none have been arrested till late on Sunday.Haldar had been driving down NSC Bose Road with three men, who had hired his car to visit the Kalighat temple. On their way back, they got caught in the immersion procession of Naktala Sarbojanin Durgotsab Committee around 9pm. “Most of them seemed drunk and kept dancing on the road, halting traffic. We moved slowly behind the procession looking for a way to get past them. Suddenly, some of them started banging the car bonnet and when I protested, an argument broke out and some of them slapped me. Soon, others came and took them away. They cleared a part of the road and let my car move ahead,” said Haldar.Even as he drove ahead and reached Lakshminarayan bridge, almost a kilometre away, Haldar noticed that a few bikes from the precession were following his car. Soon, they blocked the road and forced him to stop the car. “They charged me of knocking down a youth while I was driving through the procession. I was held by the collar and my car keys were snatched. I was taken out and assaulted. When the passengers protested, they were pushed and abused,” Haldar told TOI.The passengers were allegedly forced to get out of the car while some of the accused asked Haldar to drive the car. “I was taken to a deserted lane and asked to get down. They snatched my purse and forced me to hand over a bag in which I was carrying money for my father’s treatment. He is a cancer patient and I had borrowed the money,” said Haldar.One of the passengers, Argya Dasgupta, said the men demanded compensation for knocking down a club member.Dasgupta had managed to take a photograph of one of the bikes and cops tracked down its owner from the registration number and called him to the police station. Madhusudan Poddar, the bike owner, claimed himself to be an electrician hired by the club. He told TOI that he had not seen anyone getting hit by a car. He added that some club members had sat pillion on his bike and asked him to chase the car.Sourav Das, a member of the Dalgis club, alleged Haldar was cooking up a story and said that he was the one who had hit one of their club members. “The driver was speeding along the road and knocked down one of our club members. So we followed him. But none of our members robbed him,” he said."
2,2019-09-19T12:35:40+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: At least two persons were killed and six seriously injured in four different accidents across the city. In the first accident, four persons were injured around 4.30am on Wednesday when a truck collided with a private car at Diamond Park close to Thakurpukur. Subhajit Das (39), his wife, Barnali Das (33), Abhijit Manna (38) and Bula Das (35) who were travelling in the private car were coming to the city from Bishnupur. All the victims were rushed to the Bangur Medical Research institute. Manna was later shifted to ESI Hospital, Joka after his condition worsened. Cops who started an investigation into the accident blamed the truck driver for reckless driving. However, locals said the miserable condition of the road was also responsible for the accident. In the second accident, an unidentified man, aged around 50 years, was found dead beside a rickshaw on the DH Road on Wednesday afternoon. Though locals found the man’s death mysterious, cops did not rule out the chance that he had met with a fatal accident. In another accident, a biker lost his life and the pillion rider was seriously injured after the two-wheeler hit a median divider near 6 No. bus stand on NSC Bose Road around 3am. The deceased, Indranil Das (24), was a resident of Bijoygarh. The condition of the pillion rider, Alok Das (23), a resident of Azadgarh, was stated to be critical. Another rider was injured when his two-wheeler skidded on the Dhakuria flyover in midnight on Monday. The victim, Ankit Shaw (29), received head injuries and is undergoing treatment at AMRI Hospital."

The accident took place at around 2.20 pm at the crossing of Red Road and Mayo road near police memorial when the driver of a private bus suddenly applied the brake and two other buses from behind rammed into it, a senior officer of Kolkata police said. As a result, eight passengers received minor injuries and were rushed to SSKM hospital, he said. The driver of the offending private bus managed to flee but the drivers of the two other buses have been taken to the Maidan police station, the officer added."
4,2019-09-17T13:34:02+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: Almost nine months after the Kolkata traffic police claimed to have proposed the installation of nets, view cutters or even the advanced crash barriers up to four feet — on the southern flank of the Maa flyover in order to reduce chances of alloy-coated kite strings causing accidents and injuries to bikers — the traffic police now plans to make arrangements for nets to try and stop the area from becoming a suicide point.“It is third time now that someone has climbed on to the Maa flyover from the Park Circus side or the Pragati Maidan side and tried to commit suicide. The stretch between the 7-point crossing and the No. 4 bridge has also seen bikers tumbling over. It is important we try and convince the civic agencies — in this case the KMDA — on the utility of these barriers,” said a top IPS officer. Cops have also proposed to increase patrol on the flyover from both ends to stop a repeat of the incident where Sajad Murmu of South Dinajpur allegedly ended his life. The proposal for nets was forwarded to the KMDA through Lalbazar by the various traffic guards after studying the past accidents and suicides and looking for practical solutions. “While the local police stations might be struggling with the regular patrol, it is difficult to predict when a thread can cause an accident. We cannot predict the loss of lives due to accidents or when someone might become suicidal. But the nets can at least act as a deterrent,” said an officer.“More than one suicide at a particular site should always give cause for concern,” said a psychiatrist working with Kolkata police."
5,2019-10-13T06:00:23+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: Two buses competing with each other resulted in yet another serious accident close to Science City where a biker received serious injuries on his leg. The incident took place on Saturday evening when the biker was illegally overtaking one of the buses. The impact was such that the bike got dragged and sparks started emitting from its body. The buses and two wheelers remain two major concerns for traffic cops as both contribute to maximum number of accidents in the city. Fortunately, the biker managed to escape with injuries to his leg. The incident took place on close to Science City on EM Bypass. According to Pragati Maidan police, the biker in his early 30s was trying to overtake a bus after crossing the Parama Island. While trying to do so, he moved to the extreme left lane and accelerated. “At that time, the bus plying on the Taratala-Airport route was trying to block the path of another bus after picking up passengers. When the second bus zipped to its left trying to block the path of the Taratala bus, the Taratala bound bus moved further left.The biker came on its rear path and got hit by the bus. He tumbled and fell on the road. With the incident taking place right next to the police station and a traffic guard, the cops took the victim to the hospital. Till evening, the cops were still at the hospital noting down his statement. Police chased the bus on to the Ambedkar flyover and detained the driver. The bus, too, was seized. The other bus, however, managed to escape.Saturday’s accident took place in the zones that are marked as black spots on the EM Bypass. EM Bypass had three blackspots — Metropolitan City-Dhapa stretch, the Panchannagram stretch and the Parama Island in 2018. “This was a classic case of both the biker and the bus drivers not obeying rules and cutting lanes. We have time and again held workshops for bus drivers and bikers and issued them challans. As for buses, we feel the commission system contributes to bus competing with one another and leading to accidents,” explained an officer from the Tiljala traffic guard.Tapan Banerjee of Joint Council of Bus Syndicate said blaming the commissioning system will not address the issue of gross traffic rule violations."
6,2019-08-12T05:32:22+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: A 21-year-old helmetless biker, Abhishek Roy, was killed and his friend Manisha Roy (18) critically injured early on Sunday after Abhishek’s unregistered motorcycle crashed into a median divider on EM Bypass near Mani Square. None of them was wearing a helmet when the accident took place, said police.Soon after the cops took them to a private hospital off Bypass, Abhishek died of his injuries. Manisha is still admitted there in a very critical condition.TimesViewMultiple studies tell us that tragedies like this can be avoided if only riders wear helmets. Yet, there is a curious reluctance to wear this basic necessity. Cops have conducted several sensitisation programmes and campaigns. Perhaps, it is time to repeat that.Family sources said it was Manisha’s birthday last night. Abhishek — the only son of Basanta Cabin owner Amarnath Roy — picked her up from her Muraripukur home around 10.30pm. “Manisha told us that she was going for dinner with Abhishek and would be back before midnight. When it was too late, we got worried and tried to contact her, but there was no response. Finally, around 2.30am, a male voice from the other end told us that he was a policeman and requested us to rush to the hospital, since her condition was very serious,” said Mrittika Roy, Manisha’s sister-in-law.At Roy’s home in 288A APC Road, Abhishek’s septuagenarian grandmother Jamuna Roy said: “He had told us that he was going for a friend’s birthday party. A little after 10.30pm, he called up his mother to say that he would be late. That was the last time we heard from him.” His father could not be reached for comments.Police said the kind of damage the vehicle suffered indicated that it was on a high speed. The road, too, was slippery because of sporadic rain and that might have caused the accident. According to police sources, both victims were on the road — severely bleeding — when the cops reached the spot. “They had suffered multiple bleeding injuries, including severe head injuries,” said a police source.The Fatal Squad Traffic Police (FSTP) is handling the investigation. The damaged vehicle will undergo a forensic test. Police are also trying to find out whether the helmetless duo was intercepted by any naka check."
7,2019-08-10T05:48:46+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: A 65-year-old tailor from Dhakuria — who also trades in clothing material — almost had his ears torn off when he was thrown off the bus he had just boarded near Gariahat crossing on Friday. His finger were crushed and an elbow was also fractured in the accident that was reported around 9.40am. Samir Pal came under the wheels of a second bus which was competing with the one he was on and tried to overtake it from the left. The victim was taken to a private hospital in Dhakuria before being shifted to another hospital off EM Bypass by his family. Pal will have to undergo corrective surgeries for his injuries. However, doctors said he was stable. The locals claimed the accident took place as the second bus — plying on Route 3C/2 — was trying to overtake the Route 212 bus from the left. The two vehicles, which share a common route for a considerable stretch, had been racing with each other since Bijon Setu. Traffic cops, though, said CCTV footage suggest the victim was also negligent. “Pal had tried to spit out gutka while standing on the footboard. The Route 212 bus was standing at a signal near Citimart, about 30m from Gariahat crossing, and the signal had just turned green. The bus started with a jerk and Pal lost his balance and fell off. The 3C/2 driver would have run him over but braked at the last moment,” said an officer.The local police, however, said they have not found any evidence that Pal had been chewing gutka. He had boarded the bus from Haltu and was headed to Bhowanipore College with his son who had his Part II exams on Friday. The victim told Gariahat police that he was standing behind the conductor, and not on the footboard, when the jerk threw him off. Doctors at Peerless Hospital, where he is admitted, said Pal’s condition was stable. “There is no immediate danger to his life. He needs a complete reconstruction of his ears and we have to carry out several surgeries. He has to be under prolonged treatment,” said one of the senior doctors.“The injuries to the ears are only external. No internal injury has been found. We are planning plastic surgery to repair them. Currently, he is being treated in our emergency unit and we will shift him to the ward soon,” said Peerless CEO Dr Sudipto Mitra. “The accident happened because the second bus was trying to overtake the first one, which was standing in the middle of the road. The victim was bleeding profusely, with one of his ears hanging. The other ear seemed crushed,” said Jaydeep Ray, a shop employee who saw the accident.Cops on Friday launched a drive where passengers on government buses were asked to get off if they were found crowding near the gates. “This is a question of life and death and passengers must realize that footboards are not meant for travelling,” said an officer..(With inputs from Ayush Roy)"

But he continued to use his scooter to reach office as he was yet to get a four-wheeler driving licence. On Monday, he was thrown off the scooter while negotiating a treacherous stretch on E M Bypass and came under a bus.“Since their daughter was born, his wife used to tell him to get rid of his scooter. Prodded by her constant nudge and the deplorable condition of roads, he bought a second-hand car. He had also started to learn driving but was yet to get his hands set on the wheels and get a driving licence,” said Nasimul Islam, Samim’s brother-in-law.Just a few days before the accident, even Samim had told him that he was planning to let go of the scooter because of the poor condition of the stretch — GT Road, Belghoria Expressway, VIP Road and EM Bypass – he regularly rode to reach his office at Kasba Industrial Estate. “He had plans to give up the scooter and drive to office from his home in his car. But he died even before he could shift to the four-wheel drive,” said Islam.Samim was even looking for a flat in south Kolkata and was trying to shift to the city to cut down on his travel time.

The colleagues even rushed to the hospital and had made the hospital authorities aware of the accident and that they were bringing in a critical patient, but he never arrived.“I kept on calling Samim’s number but none responded. I then went up to the traffic guard at Ruby crossing and sought help from an officer about the whereabouts of Samim.

16,2019-08-27T06:30:13+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: Come what may, you will never find a Kavi Subhas-bound rake leaving the Dum Dum station from the Up platform. This is a procedure that Metro Railway sometimes follows at other stations when tracks are blocked due to a technical snag. Trains arriving at a platform depart from there and then change over to the proper line midway. Similarly, clear instructions have been given to operating staff to not evacuate Down rakes during peak hours at Dum Dum if there is any possibility of running them. Any attempt to evacuate a rake could result in a stampede-like situation.“When a Down train enters the platform during the morning peak hours, there are over a thousand people waiting. Passengers keep pouring in. Unless we have trains to get them out, there would be total chaos. That is what happened on Wednesday morning. We checked the CCTV footage later and realised that there were nearly 4,000 passengers on the train and platform while efforts were being made to shut one of the doors. It was a good decision to start the train with due protection,” Metro Railway principal chief operations manager Satyaki Nath said.No other station comes even close to Dum Dum’s passenger count. The next in line are the Esplanade and Rabindra Sadan stations. These stations handle about 50,000 passengers every day. Metro expects a huge rush of Puja shoppers at Esplanade from September 16 and has started taking precaution. However, all efforts will be made to clear the rush at Dum Dum, even if it means running a train with a door open, as it happened on Wednesday.“We have some space at Esplanade station and the crowd of shoppers move from both directions. Its different at Dum Dum. During the morning peak hours, all passengers are south-bound and on the Down platform. On Wednesday, there was no way we could have reversed the affected rake. Had we decided to reverse a rake towards the Down direction from the Up platform, there would have been a stampede on the stairs. Some people might have tried to cross the tracks (and electrified third rails) to reach the Up platform. Hence, we have instructed Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel at Dum Dum to maintain a strict watch so that nobody gets down on the tracks,” Nath added.On Wednesday, more people might have reached the platform at Dum Dum had the booking counters not been shut down. Senior officers urged passengers to behave rationally and not try to get into a train when there is no space."

Police said the woman, a resident of Barisha in Thakurpukur, met with the accident around 4.25pm on Tuesday.The victim, Riti Ambuli, was unmarried and earned a living by offering tuitions.Cops believe the woman was probably on her way back home when the incident took place. Cops at the Rabindra Sarobar police station have registered a case of death due to rash and negligent driving and are investigating the case. The driver of the government bus, which plies between Behala 14 number and New Town, has been arrested.In another incident, a WBTC bus seriously injured a pedestrian around 9pm on Monday. The pedestrian, Usha Rani Saha (70), was trying to cross the road at the Behala Tram Depot when the bus plying between Esplanade and Boral hit the woman. Her condition is critical, said cops quoting doctors.A recent analysis has found that 19 accidents taking place in the past two months are either due to passengers getting off moving buses, coming in front buses and slipping off the footboard. The most recent one saw a 46-yearold tailor standing on the footboard of a government bus negotiating a narrow and congested road in Haridevpur. The passenger lost his left arm after it was ripped off when the elbow got caught in the wedge of a building’s corner.“We will begin a special drive in this regard soon. The aim is to inculcate the best practices,” said DC (traffic) Santosh Pandey. The cops said they will be speaking to transport experts and even bus manufacturers in this regard. “The AC buses are the best option. But it is the private sector, whom we want to regulate,” said an officer."

20,2019-09-19T10:51:32+05:30,Times of India,"KOLKATA: Exactly four weeks after 25-year-old Raghib Parwez was arrested for allegedly being in the driver’s seat of the Jaguar that collided with a Mercedes-Benz, leading to the death of two Bangladeshi executives on the Shakespeare Sarani-Loudon Street crossing, the detective department has filed the charge sheet in the case. Besides Raghib, the primary accused, his younger brother Arsalan, 22, has also been named in the charge sheet along with their maternal uncle Md Hamza.Raghib has been charged under IPC sections 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs 50) and 279 (rash driving). “He has also been slapped with Section 3 of The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 (mischief causing damage to public property) and 119/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act (disobeying of traffic signal),” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.Raghib is in judicial custody while his brother and uncle are out on bail. Though Lalbazar officers hinted they were mulling asking for a custody trial, the defence lawyers said that now that the charge sheet has been submitted, they are talking to legal experts on approaching the courts for Raghib’s bail.Arsalan has been charged with IPC section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender). Arsalan was initially produced before police by the family as the one behind the wheels. Another 48 hours later, during sustained questioning, cops came to know that he was lying. Hamza has been charged under IPC sections 201 and 212 (harbours or conceals a person). It was Hamza who was the first family member to meet Raghib after the accident and was instrumental in sending the elder Parwez brother and his mother to Dubai the next evening. The cops said the charge sheet runs over 400 pages and officers have cited as many as 63 witnesses. Two of them hold the key to the case — Raghib’s friend who was travelling with him in the car on August 16 and fled the scene after the accident, and the Bangladeshi survivor who saw his friends die. Cops have relied hugely on technical evidence — CCTV footage and mobile locations, along with data supplied about the crash by Jaguar Land Rover. Sources said the probe has revealed that after leaving his Syed Amir Ali Avenue residence, Raghib had crossed Park Circus seven-point crossing and headed towards Mullickbazar. He attended a party at a friend’s place and then then drove towards Elliot Road and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road with another friend. He finally headed towards JL Nehru Road and took Shakespeare Sarani Road before meeting with the accident at 1.50am."

He made her lie on the middle of the main road and screamed, ‘Sahajyo korun, baba’. I heard him saying, ‘Meri biwi mar gayi’, but things were happening so fast that I can’t confirm his exact words,” he said. The girl, said Kalua, was bleeding from her mouth while there were no bruises or cuts to be seen. “I thought she was dead because something had hit her chest from the impact. The man was bleeding from all over and his shirt was stained. He was crying and asked me to find him a cab,” recalled Kalua. “A local cabbie had stopped as four-five people gathered. We asked the taxi driver if he would take them to the hospital and he agreed,” said Kalua. The rickshaw puller admitted that not a minute was lost in the process.Read Bengali articles “The man said, ‘Hum ko Ruby le ke chaliye’ and that’s what the taxi driver did.

When the sweeper asked Vikram to go to Shishumangal Hospital, he screamed, “Ruby chalo! Ruby chalo,” to the driver.After around an hour, the driver came back and met the sweeper and said that the girl was probably dead and that he was not feeling well. “He was in a state of shock and said he wanted to go home.

90,2017-01-23T15:23:11+00:00,Kolkata24*7,"Kolkata: Kolkata police is upgrading its technology, and managing traffic is getting its much needed importance in it. In an important decision, all the new 500 CCTVs being installed in the city, the cops are replacing the 2 megapixel cameras with the more powerful 5 megapixel cameras.Sources said that the decision comes from the understanding that while CCTV cameras are very useful evidence, hazy videos often ruin not only the probe but the chance to ensure conviction of the accused.“At present, both types of cameras will be used. But from now on, we will try to replace as many 2 megapixel cameras with 5 megapixel ones,” said DC (traffic) Solomon V Nesakumar. Places which witness heavy law and order deployment will be the first ones to be covered with the new cameras. The police logic is simple. They claim such cameras would help in reading the number plates even during peak traffic making zooming easier. Similarly the cops can build a bank of footages of real time violators who can be better prosecuted as recording violations will get more clarity. But there is also another reason – cops are looking to use them at the law and order problem.At present there are 2 mega pixel cameras installed at most of the crucial intersection but officers of the city’s traffic police realized that better quality video footages are required for better detection of crime and to keep a watch on a situation that may lead to law and order trouble. As a result, steps have been taken to bring major part of the city under surveillance of 5 mega pixel cameras replacing the existing 2 mega pixel ones.“The exact areas where 5 mega pixel cameras will be put up have been identified and the tenders have already been floated. Esplanade will be the first to use these cameras,” said an officer.Lalbazar sources later hinted that this was only a part of the modernization programme that was introduced recently. Besides the 50 new drones and 500 new CCTV cameras for which the tenders have already been placed, the police are also buying a number of speed guns and cameras that can read number plates even at night.The city police has 1200 CCTVs (in arrangement with private partners). The cops said they were planning to double this number. “Last year, whether it was the Red Road accident or the kidnap-and-murder of a 12-year-old at Dalhousie, CCTV footage played a key role,” said a detective department officer.The traffic police want to take it a step further by enabling the cameras to zoom in on to number plates. “This system will not only capture the registration number of a vehicle but also dig out details of the owner from the database and find the exact place of offence with latitude and longitude coordinates,” said an officer."

127,2018-12-14T02:12:53+00:00,Kolkata24*7,"Kolkata: Four-time Olympic Games gold medalist and diving legend Greg Louganis, International Event Ambassador of Tata Steel Kolkata 25K this year has graced the City of Joy today.“It’s very exciting. I admire the people who are here and going to be a part of the 25K race. Fitness is a part of life. Whether it’s diet or exercising you need to take up,” Greg said about the spirit of Tata Steel Kolkata 25K. Greg will flag off India’s only international 25K on 16 December which also celebrates Vijay Diwas as well. Greg can boast a total of 17 global gold medals to his name; including four from the Olympics, five world championships, six Pan American titles and two from the World University Games. The 1988, Seoul Olympic is famous for Greg&#39;s commitment to the game and fighting spirit. During the qualifying, he hit the back of his head on the diving board requiring several stitches, an accident that should have been competition ending.However, he came back to sweep gold in the 10m platform and also in the 3m springboard, leaving global audiences dumbstruck. About the Seoul Olympic incident and what motivated him to for the next dive Greg said: “My inspirations were Ryan White and my coach who just been there and been supportive. When I hit my head on the springboard there was so much going on. I was diagnosed with HIV positive, my coach’s mother was in coma and he didn’t know whether to stay or go home. He decided to stay with us. Both of us were rather distracted and I was the favourite but in split second after hitting the board I suddenly became underdog. I was focused and tried to do my absolute best.” With gold medals at the 1984 (Los Angeles) and 1988 (Seoul) Summer Olympics, on the springboard and platform, he is also the only male diver to sweep both diving events in successive Olympics.Being a diver how Greg feels about distance running which is an event based on timing he said: “In a road race where you have the camaraderie of the people around you, you have the similar goals and aspirations, so that can be inspiring. But if you are way ahead then that shouldn’t limit you as to how successful can you be. Rather than looking at the clock feel within your body, your heart, your soul so I think that there are many elements of competition, a performance however you want to look at it. Because maybe a competitor that’s right next to you that you will never beat in your life but you are there as companions to help each other through. So it really does become a community effort and it can be such an incredibly special moment to share that with someone because not everybody can run like that.” “You have to train for it, you work and all of a sudden your work pays off and you gotta feel good about what you are doing. That’s why when I mentor USA diving, swimming and many different sports it’s not so much about the end result. It’s about am I better today than I was yesterday? And if you can honestly say that then everyday is different. We all have bad days. Those bad days are the days where you learn a lesson. Don’t be so close that you don’t use that lesson. Not my every competition was stellar but what happened was there’s always something I could take away from that whether successful or not. That enables me to do better and move forward to the next time,” he added. After his retirement from competition in 1989, the 58-year-old American has donned many hats and always continued his commitment to excellence. He has become a mentor and coach to many top divers including members of the 2012 and 2016 US Olympic teams, a motivational speaker, author, actor, LGBT rights activist, humanitarian and an HIV/AIDS awareness advocate and designer."

This old over-bridge’s condition is not good and accidents could occur any moment. Hence, the state government has decided to demolish it and build a new one.After the Majherhat accident, the state government is worried and had set up a high-level experts committee to monitor the condition of different bridges in the city. Few days ago, the condition of the Ultadanga bridge was seen. They were not satisfied after seeing the bridge. The iron-made structure of the bridge was rusty and thus has become weak.Hence, it has been decided to demolish it and build a new bridge. This over-bridge was built for crossing roads. There are four ends to this bridge which could be used to go to 4 sides of Ultadanga. But after it was built, the people did not use much this bridge due to its height. There is lack of maintenance too. The KMD has decided that one side of the new proposed bridge will have its end extended to Bidhannagar station. Hence, the passengers will be able to easily reach the station through the over bridge. The pressure of pedestrians on the road would reduce too. As per KMD, the bridge would be of the highest quality."

139,2018-07-13T20:20:01+00:00,Kolkata24*7,"Kolkata: The Transportation department of West Bengal on Friday has announced a salary system for privatised bus drivers and conductors from August 1, 2018.A system considered to be the biggest contributor to reckless racing of buses. Minister Suvendu Adhikari announced the decision after a meeting with senior transport department officials, senior police officers and bus, minibus and taxi operators. The minister at the meeting said the salary system would become effective within soon.Earlier, it was said that the abolition of commission system, experts said, will free the entire bus operation system from the clutches of workers’ union. “Bus workers’ unions efficiently decide the duty roster of bus labourers and supply drivers and conductors if the regular drivers or conductors skip duty. The abolition can be a disruptor of a well-oiled system, if workers unions are not taken into confidence during the implementation,” said transport economist Aniruddha Sarkar.Significantly, buses are the biggest contributor to accidents on city streets. In the current system, the driver and conductor earns a percentage of the day’s total earning as their remuneration. As more passengers translate into greater income for the drivers and conductors, this system, police said, makes drivers reckless to pick up extra passengers, making the roads unsafe for all commuters.Adhikari on Thursday constituted a steering committee with senior transport department officials and senior police officers, which will oversee the smoother implementation of the abolition process and transition to the salary system.Significantly, the commission system prevails in five districts in greater Kolkata region — Kolkata, North & South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly. In the rest of the district, the salary system is in use.Transport department will also prepare time table for every route, so that buses are evenly distributed. If necessary, routes will be rationalised so that each bus can earn enough to sustain the trade, said a transport department source.Subhas Chakraborty and Madan Mitra as transport ministers had earlier tried to abolish it. The operators have now demanded guidelines from the state. “We will pay the salary but who will ensure that buses will be run on roads,” said Tapan Bandyopadhyay of Joint Council of Bus Syndicates."

The patient discharged on Tuesday.“Tarique suffered a car accident on April 28 in which a 3.5 ft long iron rod of the roadside divider broke and went through his forehead leaving him profusely bleeding and with very little life expectancy when he was brought to the hospital,” said Binod Kumar Singhania, consultant neuro surgeon at the hospital. “The case was extremely tricky as the biggest challenge was to minimise the bleeding inside the skull after removing the metal rod. As the brain remains enclosed inside the skull, too much bleeding could have damaged a large number of brain cells that may have led to the patient’s death,” the doctor said.The doctor revealed they had to get on with the surgery without much prior knowledge about the extent of the patient’s brain damage as it was difficult to conduct a CT scan with such a big piece of metal stuck in his head.They eventually removed the rod through a unique endoscopic process with proper haemostasis — a process which causes bleeding to stop. Singhania admitted that he hasn’t performed such an operation in his 30-year-long career as a neurosurgeon."

The accident-prone Chingrighata crossing may get safer for both locals and motorists with the KMDA starting construction of the first of the two proposed foot overbridges (FOB) at Captain Bhery, metres away from the Chingrighata flyover.According to the TOI report the FOB has been a consistent demand by locals after the stretch witnessed several fatal accidents this year. Kolkata Police too, has been continuously following up with the civic agency to get the plans executed. “Once the FOB becomes operational, we will dismantle the traffic lights at Captain Bhery in order to ease the commute,” said a senior Beliaghata traffic guard official.But this is not the only change at the accident-prone stretch of EM Bypass between Science City and Chingrighata crossing. In an effort to stop vehicles from bumping into one another on the north-bound flank of EM Bypass near Metropolitan, Kolkata traffic police has introduced two new signals — one right after motorists get off the Maa flyover and the other at the Avani cut out close to Metropolitan. “The road shrinks at this point and we often find vehicles coming from Science City jostling for space with cars speeding down Maa flyover. This had led to accidents in the past,” explained a senior officer at Lalbazar.For now, thus, vehicles getting off Maa flyover will be stopped for a maximum period of one minute to allow those vehicles using the Bypass to move ahead. The vehicles on the service lane will also have to stop for the same amount of time in order to allow vehicles from Science City to move towards Chigrighata. Once these 60 seconds elapse, the vehicles from Science City will be halted for a maximum of 30 seconds to allow vehicles from Maa flyover and the service roads to pass.“The plan is to allow one lane of vehicles to continue forward even as we keep another lane on hold. This is the only option available to control the volume of traffic on this stretch. This concept was introduced on the Santragachhi flyover with great success,” said DC (traffic) Sumit Kumar.The second overbridge will be built at the Chingrighata intersection to cross over Bypass from Chaulpatty Road to Jal Vayu Vihar. KMDA might install an elevator and an escalator at the FOB to facilitate cyclists and those who may have difficulty using the stairs."

The supply was stopped as it got embroiled into corruption allegations, which even led to the resignation of the then defence minister George Fernandes, who was later given the clean chit.The CBI gave Fernandes a clean chit in 2013 after the gap of 12 years. It was found during the investigations that the noting of body bags to be of 18 kg was a typographic mistake. The United States Army also uses the body bags with the weight 55 kg.On March 17, 2017, the Patiala House Court ordered the caskets to be released. Lately, an audit objection has been keeping the entire issue on hold as the objection was put up with a note to confirm with the U.S. Army about the weight of the body bags used by them. The U.S. Army also uses 55 kg weight body bags. There are 900 body bags and 150 caskets lying locked since 16 years.Though Army sources say at that altitude, a Mi-17 helicopter cannot operate with the weight of 6 caskets.“The Army teams had to put in lot of efforts to recover the dead bodies from deep down the Valley close to the Chinese border. It was a very difficult task. They however completed it. Wooden boxes are made at the Bases and then sent by Air to their homes.” Brigadier BK Ponwar, Director of Counter Terrorism and Jungle Warfare College told to Kolkata24X7.comMr. Ponwar further affirmed, “Yes Govt has been requested for ready made Coffins for the purpose. Which is pending.’’The Mi-17 V5 chopper was on an air maintenance mission, flying to Yangtse to drop off supplies at an Army camp. Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa, Chief of the Indian Air Force, said, “The tail rotor of the helicopter flew off.”When contacted with former IAF chief Arup Raha,Mr. Raha has denied to talk anything regarding the matter. “In a remote area, you can not expect it. Due to constraints in high altitude area, helicopter cannot carry full load. Mortal remains were wrapped in available local resources instead of improvised body bags or coffins.” Lt Gen Subroto Saha said.Here’s the official statement released by the army on the matter:“In a very sad accident on 6 October 2017, one MI-17V5 crashed near Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. The accident occurred in high altitude area while the helicopter was undertaking maintenance sortie. The post is not connected by any road. Immediately seeing the accident, all soldiers of the post commenced the recovery effort in the treacherous terrain. As the helicopter had caught fire, the recovery was difficult. On 6 October, the mortal remains of the crew and the soldiers who died in the helicopter crash were collected from the wreckage and were promptly moved to the nearest helipad. Due to constraints in high altitude area, helicopter cannot carry full load. Mortal remains were wrapped in available local resources instead of improvised body bags or coffins. This was an aberration.Mortal remains arrived at Guwahati Base Hospital by 2P.M. on 6 October and thereafter post-mortems and other formalities commenced.Immediately after the post-mortem, all the mortal remains were placed in the wooden coffins with full military honours. Consequent to paying of tributes as per full military honours, mortal remains of all the personnel have been sent to respective next of kin.Carriage of mortal remains, wrapped in local resources as in this case, is an aberration. Body bags, wooden boxes will be ensured.Armed Forces always ensure full military honour to the fallen comrades.”"

Today, the Kolkata Police thanked the media for saving a man in uniform, thrashed by alleged BJP workers.The BJP was trying to march today to Lalbazar, the Kolkata Police headquarters. Three different rallies converged on it. They were stopped at police barricades some distance from their target.After urging them to retreat, the police declared the rallies illegal and lathicharged. In the melee, one policeman in his early twenties got isolated and was assaulted by alleged BJP protesters. He fell. They jumped on his chest and beat him with the flat poles they had in their hands. Two journalists rushed to save him as he lay prone on the road in front of Paradise cinema hall on Bentick Street, nearly unconscious. “He had almost fainted. He could not stand up, he was shivering in fright and exhaustion,” said Tamaghna Banerjee, a reporter who rushed to rescue him. With him was another reporter Sukanta Mukherjee and his cameraperson Debashish Moitra. They too rushed forward to help. “The police was beginning to lathicharge. We saw some five-six men carrying BJP flags push this policeman to the ground and start beating him,” said Sukanta Mukherjee. Joint Commissioner Supratim Sarkar, who addressed the press, said, “I thank the media persons for what they did. We are grateful.”All three journalists who rushed to save the policeman were wearing the yellow vests with press written on them handed out by the Kolkata Police today.The move was in response to protests by the media against unprovoked attacks on them by the police on Monday. On Tuesday, the media had held a silent march in Kolkata. The police commissioner, Mr Rajiv Kumar, had mooted the idea of the yellow press vests to avoid accidental assaults. To some extent, it seems to have worked, though some journalists said the police attacked them the vests notwithstanding."

The Chauhan family has specifically wanted to know whether the actor was drunk and whether that caused the accident.গাড়ি দুর্ঘটনায় পূর্ণ তদন্তের আরজি সোনিকার পরিবারের“They have asked us to look into Vikram’s role and take appropriate action against the accused if proven guilty,” said an officer. The complaint was made at Tollygunge but a top officer indicated the case is likely to be handled by Lalbazar. “Tollygunge police, with technical help of detective department, will look into the case,” he said. “We have found the sections slapped against the actor suo motu by us to be sufficient to cover the charges made by the family,” claimed another senior officer.Though, the cops are yet to record the statement of Chatterjee. Top IPS officers at Lalbazar insisted Vikram was still not fit to face questioning. However, Ruby hospital authorities, where Vikram is presently undergoing treatment, said the actor might be released in the next 48 hours if his condition remains stable. “We have been asked to inform police before his release,” said a source. Police said the actor has to record his statement at the earliest. “We will let him recover but he cannot escape questioning,” claimed an officer, they are even mulling recording his statement before a magistrate. Sources said a probable questionnaire that will be put before the actor is ready. “Based on the car’s mechanical test and the CCTV footage of the area, we have come upon certain possibilities. Only recording the statement of the actor will help us ascertain the truth,” said a source.Sources in Lalbazar said one of the theories forwarded by experts was that the actor might have dozed off while speeding. “There is an 80-metre drag mark on the road. Yet, even after analysing footage from CCTVs installed nearby, we have not been able to locate any other vehicle crossing that particular lane around that time. Hence, it’s crucial that we seek Vikram’s help in locating the other car that his family is talking about,” said an officer.Similarly, the mechanical test has suggested that the car was being driven way above the maximum speed limit fixed for Rashbehari Avenue. “We want to ascertain the conditions under which this became a necessity,” claimed a source. Cops also want to ascertain which portion of the car hit Sonika that left her bleeding profusely from her ears and nose leading to her death."

He went out to buy some home essentials and was checking out vegetables from a roadside seller. And then, a calf fell on him from 70ft above.The six-month-old, 85kg animal died on the spot but Mannan had a miraculous escape with a fractured leg, ribs and serious head injury.The calf was kept in captivity on the terrace of a four-storey building for the past week allegedly by one of the tenants. According to local residents, it tore off the rope it was tied to, jumped over a 3ft wall and fell directly on Mannan. The bizarre incident happened around 8am on Sunday at Masjid Bari Lane in Tiljala. Also Read: Actor Vikram Injured, Model Sonika Dead In Major Accident“The tenant brought the cow to the terrace last week and kept it tied to a corner. Stacks of hay were also kept for the animal to eat. He had even hired a young man to bathe the calf,” said a person who lives in the building opposite 15G Masjid Bari Lane. “After it was bathed on Sunday, it grew restless and ran around the terrace before the rope hung around its neck tore off and the animal plunged from the terrace,” he said.As the animal crashed on Mannan, both of them slumped on the ground in a pool of blood. The calf died on the spot while bystanders took Mannan to a local nursing home before admitting him to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.“I was checking cucumbers while bending down when I suddenly felt something very heavy falling on me. As I lay on the ground, I realised it was a calf and lost sense,” said Mannan, who sells peanuts and sprout mixtures outside schools.Mannan suffered a fracture on his left leg, cracks in a rib and wounds on the back of his head, including multiple injuries all over his body that required as many as 18 stitches. “I cannot believe my husband was almost killed by a calf falling from the sky. I thank God he is alive,” said his wife Seema Begum.The owner of the building, Anjum Alam, said the calf belonged to one of the tenants who had left the building two months ago and claimed he had possibly sneaked in the calf. “The tenant, Md Alam, had left two months ago. Possibly, he still has the keys to the terrace and that is how he kept the calf in the building without our knowledge. We are trying to track him,” said Alam, whose family owns five shops on the ground floor of the building.Alam, however, added he had taken care of all the medical expenses of Mannan since it happened outside their building. “We know he is a poor man and since the incident happened because a calf jumped off our building, we also bear some responsibility for it,” he said. No police complaint was made in the case.According to locals, several residents in the Tiljala and Kushtia area keep cattle on the terrace. Khatals were declared illegal in the city municipal area in the 1980s but despite the ban, several khatals and khatal-like clusters still flourish in several parts of the city, including Tiljala."

We feel that the case could have been handled in a better way,” Shukla told reporters after his meeting with the officials of the hospital, who were summoned.Sanjoy Roy, who was admitted to the hospital on February 16 after a road accident died at the state-run SSKM hospital where he was shifted. “The incident could have been avoided with more appropriate steps,” he said adding “We have asked them (hospital officials) to appear before us with more documents in support of their explanations.” Shukla also criticised the hospital authority for taking fixed deposit papers from the patient party. “The hospital authority can’t take FD papers from patient party.” The hospital authority had yesterday said the patient’s relatives had given the FD papers to it. “We never asked for it.”State Health Services Director Biswaranjan Satpathy said “Comparatively much less expensive and simple method of treatment could have saved the youth’s life.” The Health Department officials later submitted their report to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The issue has sparked controversies following death of the patient. Family members of Roy, who was admitted to the hospital on February 16 after a road accident, have alleged that the hospital authorities refused to release him unless dues were settled and the delay to shift him caused his death.“The bill for his treatment ran into nearly Rs eight lakh and we wanted to shift him to the state-run SSKM hospital as we managed to get a bed there. We pleaded with the (private) hospital authorities to release the patient but they had insisted on the payment first,” a family member had said.The hospital authority, however, denied the allegation and said the patient’s relatives confirmed at 7 p.m that they have got a bed in the government hospital. “We had agreed (to release Roy). Subsequently, we had taken the patient in our ambulance with doctors and continued his treatment till he was put in that hospital’s bed.”Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had on Wednesday warned private hospitals against over-charging patients and negligence in treatment and announced setting up of a regulatory commission to monitor their functioning."

On 31 March 2016, part of the under-construction Vivekananda flyover in the Girish Park neighbourhood of Kolkata, India, collapsed. Twenty seven people were dead and more than 80 were injured in the incident. At 12:40 pm IST on 31 March 2016, a 150 m (490 ft) span of steel of the bridge collapsed, trapping many pedestrians and vehicles underneath. The incident took place at the busy Rabindra Sarani – K K Tagore road crossing. 27 people were killed and at least 80 others were injured. More than 90 people had been pulled from the rubble, but as of 1 April, over 100 people were still unaccounted for. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) worked in relief operations with police, and other security personnel. Many photographs and videos were quickly posted on social media platforms. On 1 April 2016, the construction company IVRCL was charged with murder, under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. The police detained five IVRCL officials in Kolkata and two in Hyderabad, and sealed off IVRCL’s local office in Kolkata. The firm called the collapse an “accident”, while one IVRCL official described it as an “act of god”. The shares of the company fell 11.7% the day after the disaster. Sixty-two families living in buildings near the accident site were asked to vacate temporarily for the safe removal of collapsed debris. In a letter sent to BSE, IVRCL claimed that the design of the flyover was done by a reputed consulting firm of Kolkata. The Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, rushed to oversee the post-crash relief and rescue operation, and made a statement blaming the previous left-wing government for the disaster. The previous state government, headed by the CPI(M), alleged that the portion of the flyover that collapsed was built during the current Government’s tenure. Minister of State for Urban Development, Babul Supriyo remarked that the construction work of the flyover was carried on in an unscientific manner and “the state administration did not take any lesson even after the collapse of Ultadanga flyover three years ago”. The legal advisor to IVRCL, Sheela Peddinti said, “The glass was shattered. It could have been a blast.” The vice-president of the Indian National Congress, Rahul Gandhi visited the injured and the site of accident. He refused to make any political statements. Later, he incidentally raised the issue at rallies and accused the ruling party, Trinamool Congress of negligence."

185,2016-04-02T08:22:00+00:00,Kolkata24*7,"Kolkata: United India Insurance, the insurer of the Vivekananda Road Flyover, is likely to send its inquiry team on Saturday.This has assumed significance because the amount of compensation the victims will get will be determined by the survey team. The insurance cover for the flyover is likely to be between Rs 190 and Rs 200 crore. The initial construction cost was Rs 164 crore when IVRCL started work in 2009. But the policy takes into account the value of the asset after completion. All the victims are entitled to get the benefit of this insurance and one doesn’t need to have any policy.An official of this Chennai-based insurer said IVRCL, the contractor, has informed the Hyderabad office of the firm regarding the flyover collapse on Thursday evening. “We will soon send a survey team for a probe. It seems that the policy is in force,” the official said. A contractor all risk policy was taken by IVRCL in 2009 when the construction was started. Such policy is mandatory for any bridge or flyover under construction. The general tenure of these policies is seven years but it can be extended depending on the requirements.Rahul Agarwal, the founder director of Ideal Insurance Brokers, said such policy has two components. “There is a cover for damage of the property and there is a third party cover as well. For loss of life and injury due to any accident involving a flyover under construction, the policy provides cover for death and injury,” he said. An official of city-based National Insurance Company (NIC) said there is a Rs 25 crore third party cover in such policies. However, the amount can be reduced if the contractor wants to do so. But this cannot be less than Rs 10 crore. “This amount is payable to all those, who are not employees of the contractor or sub contractors. For employees, every contractor has to take cover separately,” he added. The official explained that apart from death, a person with loss of limb or any other organs will get compensation from this kitty.According to him, NIC has also started the process of assessing whether any of the deceased or injured had Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Bima Yojana (PMSBY). Under this scheme, there is a personal accident cover of Rs 2 lakh which one can be availed by paying Rs 12 per year. “There is a provision of Rs one lakh for permanent disability as well,” he added.Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has decided to set up a help desk for the victims. “If we get claim related to this tragedy, we will settle the same in 24 hours,” said P K Dasgupta of LIC.According to him, there are provisions of permanent disability in some policies which would be offered to the injured if any of them have such policies. The state government has already offered Rs 5 lakh compensation for death, Rs 2 lakh for serious injury and Rs one lakh for minor injury.GraphWhat the victims can get1. The state government compensation- Rs 5 lakh for death, Rs 2 lakh for major injury, Rs 1 lakh for minor injury2. Rs 10-25 crore compensation pool from the contractor all risk policy for the flyover.
