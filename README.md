# NewsScrapper

A python application which can be used to scrape news related information from the websites using BeautifulSoup.
It was made for <b>Bengalathon 2K19</b> to scrape accident related data in nearby areas of Kolkata.
Using this data we marked the area red zone, Orange zone and green zone which indicates the how safe the area is.
The statement of the project was SafeRoads - how to make roads safe.
This was just a part of our solution, we had other entities in our solution like get accelerometer data and based on the jerks,  rate a road safe or not. Show best road among the choices using Google Maps api amongst others.
Our app - PathaPradarshak (PathFinder) made it to the finals of Bengalathon.

Presently only 3 websites are supported-
* Times of India
* Kolkata 24*7
* NDTV
